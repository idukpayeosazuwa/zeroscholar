    "passage": "Although today used to describe any movement to claim back territory for ethnic, linguistic, geographical or historical reasons, the term irredentism originally came from the Italian nationalist movement Italia irredenta. Meaning \"unredeemed Italy\", Italian irredentism was an opinion movement rather than a formal organisation. It sought to unify ethnically Italian territories, such as Trieste, Trentina, and Istria, that were outside of Italian borders at the time of the unification of Italy in 1866. The annexation of these Italian territories from Austria provided Italy with its strongest motive for participating in World War I. The Treaty of Versailles in 1919 satisfied most of Italy's irredentist claims, however new borders delineated by the treaty gave rise to new irredentist claims. Dividing the German Empire into separate nations created German minority populations in the new countries of Poland and Hungary. German irredentist claims to these territories, as well as to Austria, resulted in the Second World War. The Treaty of Versailles created Yugoslavia to be a Slavic homeland, but ethnic and religious differences between Bosnians, Serbs and Croats eventually led to war in the 1990s. The artificial political states created by the Treaty of Versailles in East Africa failed to take tribal boundaries into account, and thus remain subject to irredentist claims. Similarly, borders drawn up in the Near East are still contentious today.",

    "explanation": "Cannot say – while the third sentence lists these areas as Italian territories, and the fifth sentence states that the Treaty of Versailles \"satisfied most of Italy's irredentist claims\" the passage does not expressly state that these territories became part of Italy."

    "passage": "Many organisations predict that the global water crisis presents this century's biggest threat. Today 84% of people in developing countries have access to clean water, 2 billion more than in 1990. However, millions still lack clean water for drinking and sanitation, posing a major health threat. In the developed world, water consumption is unsustainably high, doubling every twenty years. Agriculture accounts for 70% of the world's fresh water use, and an increasing population to feed means this demand will only increase. Groundwater sources, used to irrigate crops, are running dry because of overuse. While limiting the use of groundwater is a possible solution, it would have a financial impact on farmers and result in lower yields. While climate change has resulted in increased precipitation in some areas, it is contributing to water shortages in other regions. Rising temperatures have caused the Himalayan glaciers, the source for all of Asia's major rivers, to retreat. A reservoir for nearly half of the world's fresh water, these glaciers are predicted to lose four-fifths of their area by 2040. The solution to the global water crisis lies predominantly in new technologies. Desalination plants, which convert seawater into fresh water, have now been built in countries including Israel and Singapore. The process's high costs however limit its widespread adoption. Organising bodies and treaties are also needed to ensure that cross-border water sources are managed properly and do not become a source of conflict.",

Having experienced ethnic divisions and language barriers growing up in Poland, he aimed to create an easy-to-learn second language that could transcend cultural and political differences and further international peace. Although Zamenhof's goal of a universal auxiliary language was not realized, today there are 1.6 million Esperanto speakers in more than 90 different countries.
