    "passage": "Nobody knows what life forms may exist outside our own planet. The search for extra-terrestrial life in the universe took a step nearer to fruition with the discovery in June of what are believed to be traces of water on the surface of Mars. Life on our planet requires water and its presence on Mars may point towards the existence of past life on the planet. The Phoenix Mars Lander robot landed on the plains of Mars on May 25th 2008, searching for signs that the Martian environment might once have been habitable to life. When it dug a ditch in the planet's surface, photos revealed small patches of bright material. Four days later those patches had disappeared, causing scientists to speculate that they were water ice that had previously been buried and which vaporised when exposed to the air. Scientists insisted that if the patches had been salt, they would not have disappeared and if they had been solid carbon dioxide, then they would not have vaporised.",
    "question": "The Phoenix Mars Lander has provided proof that life once existed on Mars.",
    "options": ["A) True", "B) False", "C) Cannot say"],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Cannot say - The passage states that scientists speculate that there were ice patches on Mars, which is needed for life. We are told about the Phoenix Mars Lander and its discovery but we are not told what the Phoenix Mars Lander has proved, disproved, or failed to prove. So we cannot say if this is true or false without further information."

    "explanation": "Cannot say - The passage states that Life on our plant requires water. The passage also says that we do not know about every single life form: Nobody knows what life forms may exist outside our own planet. Given that the passage does not tell us whether all life on Mars (or any planet other than our own) does or does not require water, we cannot say whether or not this statement is true or false."

    "passage": "Most workers in the UK over the age of 16 are legally entitled to a minimum rate of pay, called the national minimum wage. An independent body called the Low Pay Commission (LPC) each year reviews this rate and passes their recommendation to the government, who then set and enforce the rate. With few exceptions, the minimum wage is the same for all types of work and all kinds of business. The current amount for people over 22 years of age is 6.80 pounds per hour. The rates for younger workers are less. However, the following groups are not entitled to receive the minimum wage: workers under school leaving age, the genuinely self-employed, some apprentices, au pairs, armed service personnel and voluntary workers. Also agricultural workers have a separate minimum rate of pay set by the Agricultural Wages Board.",

    "passage": "A common difficulty faced by business managers is when the behaviour of a team-member conflicts with established desirable practice. How does a good leader handle such an issue? One effective angle is to lead by example: instead of waiting for a problem to develop, take a proactive approach in heading it off with reference to clearly laid out guidelines. If a problematic situation does develop, controlling it can be made simpler by invoking existing values from a mission statement which has been set out in advance. A good team will always put the needs of the organisation first. Taking such an approach gives the team a sense of personal involvement which encourages them to feel part of the organisation's mission, internalising the needs of the group rather than feeling a sense of externally imposed obligation. It provides team members with a greater sense of personal control, the sense that they have contributed individually, and by choice, to the well-being of their organisation. To achieve this, a manager must have a good understanding of the way individual people communicate - a flexible approach is essential, using real-life practical examples relevant to each team-member's particular experience.",
