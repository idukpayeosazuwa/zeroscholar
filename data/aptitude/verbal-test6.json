    "passage": "Open-source software should not be confused with freeware, or software that is available to install free of charge. While most open-source software is free, there are many other criteria – namely that the source code must be available to the general public via an open-source license, and that anyone is allowed to modify it. Any modifications made must also be distributed under the same terms as the original software. Proponents of the open-source movement believe this collaborative development methodology results in quicker improvements and software that can be easily adapted to users' needs. Financial savings are another main benefit of open-source software. Because numerous programmers are able to identify and fix problems, advocates believe open-source software is more reliable than proprietary software. The majority of commercial software protects its source code to prevent competitors from developing a competing product. By only making a compiled, ready-to-run version available, software manufacturers retain full control over their product, which they argue ensures higher levels of quality and security. End-users must purchase a license fee, and typically benefit from a warranty and technical support. Although open-source software does not charge license fees to fund its development, it does not follow that it cannot be commercially viable.

Approximately 90% of the world's earthquakes occur in this zone, including the largest ever recorded – Chile's 1960 Valdivia earthquake. There are an estimated 452 volcanoes – 75% of the world's total – located in this 40,000 km belt. On its Eastern side, the Ring of Fire stretches along South and Central America up to Canada and Alaska, and includes California's well-known San Andreas fault zone. To the west of the Pacific, it extends from Russia down to Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia and New Zealand. The Ring of Fire finishes in Antarctica, which is home to Mount Erebus, the world's southern-most active volcano. The volcanic eruptions and earthquakes that characterise the Ring of Fire can be explained by plate tectonics, a unifying geological theory first expounded in the 1960s. The Earth's surface is comprised of tectonic plates that change size and shift over time. Earthquakes are caused when plates that are pushing against each other suddenly slip. Volcanoes occur only when two adjacent plates converge and one plate slides under the other, a process known as subduction. As it is pushed deeper into the Earth, the subducted plate encounters high temperatures and eventually molten rock rises to the surface and erupts.",
