    "passage": "Huge controversy surrounded the construction between 1994 and 2006 of what was the world's largest hydroelectric dam, the Three Gorges Dam. Spanning China's 1.4-mile wide Yangtze River in the Hubei province with twenty-six state-of-the-art turbines, the dam has been heralded by the Chinese state as a symbol of China's modernisation and engineering prowess. It supports China's economic development by supplying over ten percent of its electricity. However, over 1.3 million people were deliberately displaced as part of the Gorges flooding project that created the dam's 660km-long reservoir. Hundreds of archaeological sites, initially above and below ground level, were lost under the reservoir's water. Questions remain as to whether the dam – as a source of renewable energy – benefits the surrounding environment, or depletes it by causing, for example, landslides and the death of fish species in the Yangtze. Supporters argue that the Dam's deepening of the river has made the Yangtze easier for large ships to navigate and has reduced the risk of flooding downstream. As the only other viable Chinese energy source continues to be non-renewable coal power, the hydroelectric power generated by the dam may be the lesser of two evils.",
    "question": "The environmental impacts of the Three Gorges Dam have been more positive than negative.",
    "options": ["A) True", "B) False", "C) Cannot say"],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Cannot say – The passage lists both the positive and negative environmental impacts and argues for both sides, concluding \"the dam may be the lesser of two evils\"."

    "passage": "The Dead Sea Scrolls are probably the most significant archaeological discovery of the twentieth century. More than 800 ancient documents, written on papyrus and parchment, were found in 1947 in desert caves at Qumran, near the Dead Sea. The texts mainly date from between the last century BCE and the first century CE and are comprised of three types of document: copies of books from the Hebrew Bible; apocryphal manuscripts; and documents pertaining to the beliefs and practices of a sectarian community. The former category is arguably of the greatest academic significance, as documents such as a complete copy of the Book of Isaiah enabled historians to analyse the accuracy of Bible translations. However, the secrecy of the scholars appointed by the Israeli Antiquities Authority, and their slow rate of publication, were the subject of international controversy. In 1991, the Huntington Library made photographic images of the full set of scrolls finally available to all researchers. While the scrolls' importance is indisputable, there is no consensus over the texts' origins. The traditional view is that the scrolls belonged to an ascetic Jewish sect, widely believed to be the Essenes. The Essenes' rules and doctrines are even seen by some scholars as a precursor to Christianity. A competing theory holds that the documents are sacred texts belonging to various Jewish communities, hidden in the caves for safekeeping around 68CE, during the unsuccessful Jewish Revolt against the Romans in Jerusalem.",
