    "passage": "Work-related stress is one of the biggest causes of sick leave in the UK. If you've noticed you always seem to be rushing about, or miss meal breaks, take work home or don't have enough time for relaxation, seeing your family or for exercise, then you may well find yourself under stress, especially at work. There is often no single cause of work-related stress, but it can be caused by poor working conditions, long hours, relationship problems with colleagues, or lack of job security. Stress is often the result of a combination of these factors that builds up over time. Work-related stress can result in both physical problems such as headaches, muscular tension, back or neck pain, tiredness, digestive problems and sweating; or emotional problems, such as a lower sex drive, feelings of inadequacy, irritability and lack of concentration. According to recent surveys, one in six of the UK working population said their job is very stressful, and thirty percent of men said that the demands of their job interfere with their private lives.",
    "question": "Stress at work is often caused by relationship problems with your partner.",
    "options": ["A) True", "B) False", "C) Cannot say"],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Cannot say - This may well be true, but is not stated in the passage so we have to answer Cannot Say. The passage refers only to relationship problems with colleagues and does not say if relationship problems with a partner do or don't cause stress."

    "passage": "For many years the hunt has been on to find an effective way to treat cancerous tumours using physical rather than chemical means. That hunt may now be over with the latest breakthrough made by Dr Jennifer West at Rice University in Houston, Texas. West has done tests on animals using a non-chemical procedure known as Photothermal Ablation. She injected millions of nanoparticles, which can absorb infrared light, into the animals' bloodstreams. These particles go straight to the tumours because, unlike healthy tissue, tumours have abnormal blood capillaries that will let them through. A few hours later an optical fibre is inserted into the tumour and a blast of infrared light is passed down the fibre, which heats the particles and effectively cooks the tumour.",

    "passage": "U3b Networks (U3b being short for the underprivileged three billion who lack internet access) is a company in Jersey set up by Greg Wyler, former owner of Rwanda's national telephone company. His company intends to provide cheap, high-speed internet access to remote areas in developing countries, which up to now has been the reserve of developed countries. Mr Wyler plans to charge $500 per megabit per month, compared with the $4,000 charged by existing companies. Mr Wyler has so far raised 40 million euros from investors, but this seems like a risky investment, especially as billions were lost on similar projects in the past. So why are people investing in the hope of finding customers in the world's poorest regions? The reason is that previous projects were over-ambitious and set out to provide global coverage, whereas U3b's project is far more modest in its optimism and its services will be available only to a 100km wide corridor around the equator, which happens to cover most developing countries. It will initially use just five satellites circling 8,000km above the equator and further expansion will be determined by customer appetite.",

Workplace bullying is the abuse of a position of power by one individual over another. Otherwise known as harassment, intimidation, aggression, coercive management and by other euphemisms, bullying in the workplace can take many forms involving gender, race or age. In a nutshell, workplace bullying means behaviour that is humiliating or offensive towards some individual. This kind of bullying ranges from violence to less obvious actions like deliberately ignoring a fellow worker.",
