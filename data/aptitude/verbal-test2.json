    "passage": "The parable of the broken window, also known as the glazier's fallacy, is a concept used to illustrate the fact that money spent due to destruction does not result in a benefit to society. It has been suggested that repairing broken windows may provide employment to tradespeople, which could positively impact the economy through job creation. However, had the window not been broken, the money spent repairing it could have contributed elsewhere to the economy. Similarly, if windows never broke, those tradespeople would be free to contribute towards the economy in other occupations. The glazier's fallacy highlights the fact that destruction of property impacts economic activity in unseen or ignored ways, which are frequently overshadowed by more obvious economic effects.",
    "question": "The destruction of property negatively impacts the economy.",
    "options": ["A) True", "B) False", "C) Cannot say"],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Cannot Say - The passage does not state that the mere destruction of property negatively impacts the economy, only that the money spent repairing it does not benefit society, rather than the economy. Therefore, the correct answer is Cannot Say."

    "passage": "The paradox of thrift, as popularised by John Keynes, highlights the fact that excessive saving during times of economic recession negatively impacts the economy. When spending is reduced due to excessive saving, aggregate demand falls, resulting in lowered economic growth. This excessive saving results in reduced economic growth, which in turn encourages further excessive saving, causing a vicious cycle. Reduced economic growth results in reductions in salary, job security and interest on savings, negatively impacting both savers and the economy. However, it could be argued that savings held in savings accounts represent loanable capital, which banks could use to stimulate the economy via lending and investment.",
    "question": "Excessive saving has no impact on economic growth.",
    "options": ["A) True", "B) False", "C) Cannot say"],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "False - The passage states that excessive saving lowers aggregate demand, resulting in lowered economic growth, which would impact economy growth. Therefore, the correct answer is False."

    "passage": "The Moravec's paradox is the counter intuitive discovery by artificial intelligence researchers that advanced reasoning requires very little computational power, but basic sensory-motor skills are incredibly computationally complex.

However, extremely basic activities, such as recognising faces or walking up a set of stairs requires vast computational resources, and can only be accomplished by the most advanced artificial intelligences.
